## Java Basics

### Language Basics

Variables
  - Instance Variables
    - Non-Static Fields
    - Values are unique to each instance of a class
  - Class Variables
    - Static Fields
    - Tells computer that there is exactly one instance of the variable in existence
  - Local Variables
    - ex: `int count = 0`
  - Parameters
    - ex: `public static void main(String[]args)`

  - Roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages
  - a complete unit of execution
