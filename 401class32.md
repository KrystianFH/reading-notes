## Serverless and Amplify

### Serverless

What is Serverless?
  - a cloud computing execution model
  - the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers
    - relies *solely* on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic, and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls
  - runs in stateless compute containers that are:
    - event triggered
    - ephemeral (can last for one invocation)
    - fully managed by the cloud provider
  - pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity

Cloud Providers
  - AWS Lambda
  - Google Cloud Functions
  - Azure Functions
  - IBM OpenWhisk
  - Alibaba Function Compute
  - Iron Functions
  - Auth0 Webtask
  - Oracle Fn Project
  - Kubeless

Pros
  - **For Businesses**
    - Cost
      - Based on number of function executions
      - Lower cost of hiring backend infrastructure engineers
      - Lower operational cost
    - Process Agility
  
  - **For Devs**
    - Reduced liability
    - Zero system administration
    - Easier operational management
    - Fosters adoption of Nanoservices, Microservices, and SOA principles
    - Faster setup
    - Scalable
    - Monitoring out of the box
    - Innovative

Cons
  - **For Businesses**
    - Reduced overall controll
    - Vendor lock-in requires more trust for a third-party provider
    - Additional exposure to risk requires more trust for a third-party provider
    - Security risk
    - Disaster recovery risk
    - Cost is unpredictable because number of function executions is not predefined
    - Drawbacks can be mitigated with open-source alternatives at the expense of cost benefits

  - **For Devs**
    - Component fragmentation, unclear best practices
    - Architectural complexity
    - The discipline required against function sprawl
    - Multi-tenacity means it is possible that neighbor functions could hog the system resources behind the scenes
    - Testing logically becomes risky
    - Many restrictions on the local state
    - Execution duration is capped
    - Lack of operational tools
  
  - **For Users**
    - App could provide a poor user experience due to increased request latency

### AWS Amplify

What is AWS Amplify?
  - an end-to-end solution that enables mobile and front-end web developers to build and deploy secure, scalable full stack applications powered by AWS
  - allows for:
    - fast backend configuration
    - easy connection of backend to app
    - simple deployment of static web apps
    - faster go-to-market process

Components
  - three main components:
    - libraries
    - UI components
    - Command Line Interface (CLI) toolchain
  - can be used together or on their own
  - libraries and UI components work with existing front-end frameworks such as:  
    - React
    - React Native
    - Angular
    - Vue 
    - Ionic
