## Arrays, Loops, Imports

### Java Imports

Java imports flow naturally from packages. Classes are organized into packages, and to use them they must be imported into a project. 

Imports look like:  
`import java.util.Calendar`  
`import java.util.Date`

They are found at the very beginning of code segments, and make it easier to reference packages throughout your code.

### Java Loops

Looping facilitates a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean expression's answer is false. 

**Types**
  - *for* loop
    - allows certain operations to be repeated by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.  
  - *for-each* loop
  - *While* loop
    - Java's most fundamental loop statement
    - repeats a statement or block of statements while the controlling Boolean expression's answer is true
  - *Do-While* loop
    - works similarly to *while* loops
    - the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop
