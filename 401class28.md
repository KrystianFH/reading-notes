## RecyclerView

Use Case
- `RecyclerView` is used when an app needs to display:
  - a scrolling list of elements based on large data sets
  - data that frequently changes

What is `RecyclerView`?
- a widget that is more advanced and flexible than `ListView`

How does `RecyclerView` work?
- several different components work together to display your data.
- the overall container for your user interface is a `RecyclerView` object that you add to your layout.
- `RecyclerView` fills itself with views provided by a layout manager that you provide.
- `RecyclerView` does a lot of optimization work itself, like:
  - creating and binding some view holders on either side of the list
  - as the user scrolls, it creates new view holders as necessary
  - when displayed items change, there is an adapter accessed by the `RecyclerView.Adapter.notifyâ€¦()` method that rebinds just the affected items

Requirements
- v7 Support Libraries added into `build.gradle` file
- `dependencies {
    implementation 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:28.0.0'
  }`
