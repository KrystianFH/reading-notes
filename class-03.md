### Decisions and Loops | Ch 4 | JavaScript & JQUERY by Jon Duckett

Switch statements are used when a certain response is warranted for several different variables.  

Ex.  

Creating a message specific to the level a user may be on.

Creating a message specific to a certain age response.

Also, it is important to pay attention to the response being given and how the expression is written to determine if the answer is correct or not.

Loops are used when a certain function will be run again and again until the expression is satisfied.
