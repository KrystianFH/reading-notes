## The Call Stack

What is a call stack?
  - a mechanism for an interpreter (such as JS) to keep track of its place in a script which calls multiple functions

[REFERENCE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack)

What are call stacks used for?
  - function invocations

How do call stacks work?
  - Last In, First Out Principle (LIFO)
    - the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to come out when the function is returned
  - Temporary Storage
    - when a function is called, the function is pushed into the call stack to form a *stack frame*
  - Manage function calls
    - maintains a record of the position of each stack frame
    - allows JS to be synchronous

What is stack overflow?
  - when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself), without an exit point
