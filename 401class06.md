## Inheritance and Interfaces

### Inheritance

What is inheritance?
  - the concept that allows classes to be derived from other classes, and thus take on fields and methods from those classes

Example
  - a class that is derived from another class is called a *subclass*
    - derived class
    - extended class
    - child class
  - the class from which the subclass is derived is called a *superclass*
    - base class
    - parent class
  
More on Inheritance
  - the `Object` class is at the top of the class hierarchy
    - Methods:
      - `toString()`
      - `equals()`
      - `clone()`
      - `getClass()`
  - to prevent a class from being subclassed, use the `final` keyword in the classes declaration
  - abstract classes can only be subclassed, not instantiated
  - abstract classes can contain abstract methods (methods that are declared but not implemented) via subclass implementation.




### Interfaces

What are interfaces?
  - a "contract" that spells out how software interacts
  - used in situations when it is important for a group of programmers need to define their software interaction
  - allows programmers to write code according to the contract without ever seeing another programmer's code

Tell me more
  - interfaces are reference types
    - similar to a class
    - can *ONLY* contain 
      - constants
      - method signatures
      - default methods
      - static methods
      - nested types
    - connot be instantiated, can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces
    - can be used anywhere a type can be used
