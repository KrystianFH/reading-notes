What is Amplify authentication?
- provides an interface for authenticating a user
- provides the necessary authorization to the other Amplify categories
- comes with default, built-in support for:
    - Amazon Cognito User Pool 
    - Identity Pool
- Amplify CLI helps you to create and configure the auth category with an authentication provider

Installation Requirements
- An Android application targeting at least Android SDK API level 16 with Amplify libraries integrated

Authentication vs Authorization
- Authentication:
  - a process to validate who you are
  - aka *AuthN*
  - done via Identity Provider (IdP)
    - your own self-hosted IdP
    - cloud service
      - Facebook
      - Google
      - Amazon

- Authorization:
  - the process of validating what you can access 
  - aka *AuthZ*
