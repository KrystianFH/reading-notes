## Sending Form Data

When is it okay to submit a form?
  - Once the form data has been validated

What happens to the data once a form is submitted?
  - data is sent to the sever via an HTTP protocol
  - the server receives a string that will be pared in order to get the data as a list of key : value pairs

Sinding Files
  - Files are binary data, whereas other data is text data.
  - To specify the type of data being send, files must have the `Content-Type` header specified. 
    - this tells the server whether to expect text data or binary data

Security Issues
  - HTML forms are the most susceptible servers to attacks
  - These attacks originate from how the server handles the data
  - Rule of Thumb:
    - **NEVER TRUST YOUR SERVER**
  - Escape potentially dangerous characters
  - Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what is necessary
  - Sandbox uploaded files
