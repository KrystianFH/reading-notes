### Duckett HTML & CSS  | Chapter 17 | HTML Layout

    HTML5 is the most up-to-date version of html code. New elements in HTML5 indicate the purpose of various parts of a web page and are descriptive of the web page's structure.

Older browsers may need to be told which elements are block-level elements, as they might not understand HTML5 elements.

In order to make HTML5 work in Internet Explorer 8 and older versions, additional JavaScript is needed.
