# Forms and Events

### Duckett HTML & CSS | Chapter 7  | Forms

**Forms**
  - live inside the \<form> element
  - used to collect information from visitors

Information inside of a form is sent in name/value pairs.

**How do they work?**
  - Each form control is given a name
  - the text that the user inputs, or the values of the options that the user selects are sent to the server

There are updates in HTML5 that make forms more user-friendly, like:
  - Email Input
  - URL Input
  - Search Input
  - Date Input
  - Form Validation

### Duckett HTML & CSS | Chapter 14  | Lists, Tables & Forms

There are special CSS properties that are used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms. 

**List Markers**
  - use:
      - list-style-type
      - list-style
  
**Table Cells**
  - have special CSS properties to control borders and spacing across varying browsers
      - width
      - padding
      - text-transform
      - letter-spacing
      - font-size
      - border-top
      - border-bottom
      - text-align
      - background-color
      - :hover  

**Forms**  
Forms are easier to use when the form controls are vertically aligned.

Forms also benefit from interactive styling

### Duckett JavaScript & JQUERY | Chapter 6  | Events

**What are *events*?**  
Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened in a browser
  - button has been clicked
  - page has finished loading

**Binding**
  - the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen *AND* which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon (p.292)

**Events and Elements**

When an event occurs on an element, JavaScript functions can be triggered.

If the triggered function then changes the webpage, **it makes that page feel more interactive to the user**. 

**Event Delegation**  
Used to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.

*The most commonly used events are **W3C DOM** events*
