## Object Oriented Design

### S.O.L.I.D. Principles

The first five principles of object-oriented design are known as *S.O.L.I.D.* principles.
  - S : Single-responsibility principle
  - O : Open-closed principle
  - L : Liskov substitution principle
  - I : Interface segregation principle
  - D : Dependency Inversion principle  

Code that follows S.O.L.I.D. principles can more easily:
  - be shared with collaborators
  - extended
  - modified
  - tested
  - refactored without issues

Let's Take a Closer Look
  - S : Single-responsibility principle
    - A class should only have one and only one reason to change
    - A class should have only one job
  
  - O : Open-closed principle
    - Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

  - L : Liskov substitution principle
    - Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. 
    - Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of Type S where S is a subtype of T. 

  - I : Interface segregation principle
    - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use
    - Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

  - D : Dependency Inversion principle
    - Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions
    - The high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions
