## Maps, Primitives, File I/O

### Primitives

In Java, every primitive type corresponds to a reference type.  

Every object contains a single value of the corresponding primitive type.

**Wrapper Classes**
  - immutable: their state can't change once an object is constructed
  - final: nothing can be inherited from them

Java performs a conversion between the primitive and its reference type **if** an actual type is different from the declared type.  

`Integer j = 1;` (autoboxing)  
`int i = new Integer(1);` (unboxing)

The process of converting a primitive type to a reference type is called **autoboxing**.  

The process of converting a reference type to a primitive type is called **unboxing**.

Primitive Type Variables + Memory Impact
  - boolean : 1 bit
  - byte : 8 bits
  - short, char : 16 bits
  - int, float : 32 bits
  - long, double : 64 bits  

Primitive types are faster and do not require as much memory, so they should be the preference.

Objects are slower and have bigger memory impact than their primitive counterparts.

Default Values
  - numeric : 0 
  - boolean : false
  - char : \u0000
  - wrapper class : null

Primitive types may acquire values only from their domains.

Reference types may acquire a value that doesn't belong to their domains (null)

### Exceptions

What is an exception?
  - an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions

Exceptions are used to indicate that an error has occurred. 

Throwing an Exception
  - use the `throw` statement and provide it with an exception object to provide information about the specific error that occurred.

Catching Exceptions
  - `try` : identifies a block of code in which an exception can occur
    - should contain at least one `catch` block or a `finally` block
    - may have multiple `catch` blocks
  - `catch` : identifies a block of code (exception handler) that can handle a particular type of exception
  
  - `finally` : identifies a block of code that is guaranteed to execute, and is the right place to close files, recover resources, and otherwise clean up the code in the try block
