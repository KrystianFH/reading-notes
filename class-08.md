# CSS Layout

### Layout | Ch 15 | HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett 

Each item on a web page is contained in its own element. The way these elements fall on the page is controlled through changes in CSS. 

CSS styles everything from the font, color, and background. 

CSS also gives characteristics to the boxes on the page and how they behave on the page. 

It is important to consider all of the devices that will be able to display your content because the display size of these devices can vary greatly and distort your page. 

**Div elements**   
  - Often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page

**You must tell the browser how to display the page:**
  - normal flow (default)
  - relative positioning
  - absolute positioning 
  - fixed positioning

**Float:**
  - moves content to the left or right of the page 
  - can be used to create multi-column layouts
  - require a defined width

**Width of Pages**  
  - fixed
  - liquid or stretchy
  - should be between 960-1000 px wide
  - top 600 pixels should contain page info
      - to be seen without scrolling

**Grids**
  - help create professional designs
  - help create flexible designs

**CSS Framework**
  - provide rules for common tasks in CSS

You can include *MULTIPLE* CSS files in one page!
