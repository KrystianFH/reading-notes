Links allow the user to move from one page to another.

Links are created using the \<a\> element.  

Only the text between the opening \<a\> tag and the closing \</a\> tag will be shown.

### Layout | Ch 15 | HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett 

Each item on a web page is contained in its own element. The way these elements fall on the page is controlled through changes in CSS. 

CSS styles everything from the font, color, and background. 

CSS also gives characteristics to the boxes on the page and how they behave on the page. 

It is important to consider all of the devices that will be able to display your content because the display size of these devices can vary greatly and distort your page.
