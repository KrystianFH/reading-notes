## Intents, Activities, and SharedPreferences

Task
- a collection of activities that users interact with when performing a certain job

Activities
- arranged in a stackâ€”the back stack)in the order in which each activity is opened

Home Screen

- The device Home screen is the starting place for most tasks. When the user touches an icon in the app launcher (or a shortcut on the Home screen), that app's task comes to the foreground. 

- If no task exists for the app (the app has not been used recently), then a new task is created and the "main" activity for that app opens as the root activity in the stack.

Managing Tasks

- Android manages tasks by placing all activities started in succession in the same task and in a "last in, first out" stack

Launch Modes
- Launch modes allow you to define how a new instance of an activity is associated with the current task.
  - Using Manifest file
  - Using Intent flags
