## EJS Partials 

Partials *are* native to EJS.

When to use EJS Partials
  - When you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.

Why?
  - They make large websites easier to maintain, allowing a developer to define a reusable bundle of code in a file and include that bundle wherever it is needed.

Situations
  - Nav Bar
  - Footer
  - Reusable text that stays static

Syntax
  - `<%-  %>`
