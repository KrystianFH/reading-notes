#JS Object Literals: The DOM

### Duckett JavaScript & JQUERY  | Chapter 3  | Object Literals

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something recognizable in the real world.

Variables become known as properties.

Functions become known as methods.

Variables, named functions, properties and methods all have a name and a value.
  - In an object, this is called a __key__.

  Keys are separated from values using a colon. 

### Duckett JavaScript & JQUERY  | Chapter 5  | Document Object Model

Document Object Model \(DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
