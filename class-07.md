## More CSS Layout

### Duckett HTML & CSS  | Chapter 15  | Layout

Each item on a web page is contained in its own element. The way these elements fall on the page is controlled through changes in CSS. 

CSS styles everything from the font, color, and background. 

CSS also gives characteristics to the boxes on the page and how they behave on the page. 

It is important to consider all of the devices that will be able to display your content because the display size of these devices can vary greatly and distort your page.
