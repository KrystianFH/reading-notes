# Programming with JavaScript

## The ABCs of Programming - JavaScript and JQUERY by Jon Duckett

What is a script?
>a series of intstructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

Each time a script runs, it might not run all of the code depending on the rules written in to the code. 

Computers solve tasks programatically, so the instructions must be clear.

When beginning to write a script, start by breaking the end goal down into small tasks. 

From there, work on each small task step-by-step using flowcharts if needed. 

## Expressions and Operators - JavaScript and JQUERY by Jon Duckett

__Expression__
> evaluates into (results in) a single value and consists of two types
- Expressions that only assign a value to a variable
    - _var color = beige_
- Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
    - _var area = 3 * 2;_

__Operators__
> allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
- __Assignment operators__
    - assign a value to a variable
    - _color = 'beige'_
- __Arithmetic operators__
    - perform basic math
    - __+, -, /, *, ++, --,%__
    - _area = 3 * 2_
- __String operators__
    - combine two strings
    - _greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly';
- Comparison operators
    - compare two values and return true or false
    - _buy = 3 > 5;_
- Logical operators
    - combine expressions and return true or false
    - _buy = (5>3) && (2<4)_

## Functions - JavaScript and JQUERY by Jon Duckett

#### What is a function?
> allows a series of statements to be grouped together to perform a specific task.

When you task a function to perform its task it is called __calling__ the function.

Some funcgtions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task. Pieces of information passes to a function are known as __parameters__.

When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a __return value__.


#### Calling a function

The function acts lika a store; it holds the statements that are contained in the curly brackets until you are ready to use them. To run these statements, the function MUST be __called__.

To run the code in a function, use the function name followed by parentheses:

_sayHello();_
