## Database Normalization

What is *Database Normalization*?  
  - a process used to organize a database into tables and columns  

Why?
  - to minimize duplicate data
  - to minimize/avoid data modification issues
  - to simplify queries

Issues with Duplicate Information
  - increases storage
  - decreased performance
  - more difficult to maintain data changes

Common forms of Database Normalization
  - First Normal Form, **1NF**
    - information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values.
    - no repeating groups of columns
  - Second Normal Form, **2NF**
    - table is in first normal form
    - all columns depend on the table's primary key
  - Third Normal Form, **3NF**
    - table is in first normal form
    - table is in second normal form
    - all columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
