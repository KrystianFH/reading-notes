## Object-Oriented Programming

What is an object?
  - a software bundle of related state and behavior
  - state is stored in *fields*
  - behavior is stored in *methods*

What is a class?
  - the blueprint/prototype from which objects are created
  - The class body (the area between the braces) contains all the code that provides for the life cycle of the objects created from the class: 
      - constructors
      - declarations
      - methods
