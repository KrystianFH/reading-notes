## Heroku Deployment

To deploy an app on Heroku, first you need to create an app on Heroku by using the `heroku create` command in the terminal. 

This action prepares Heroku to receive source code. 

This action also creates a git remote that is associated with the local git repository.

Heroku generates a random name for this app if no parameter is passed to specify a name for the app.

To deploy the code, use the command `git push heroku master` in the terminal. 

Once deployed, use the command `heroku ps:scale web=1` in the terminal to check that the app is running.

The app can be opened with the following command: `heroku open`.
