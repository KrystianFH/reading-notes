# Choosing a Text Editor

A text editor essentially allows the user to manage and write text. 
They can be either downloaded and installed on your computer or accessed via the internet. 
Text editors are useful to developers and are very popular tools for building web sites. 

When deciding on a text editor for your own use, the most important factor will be how much you enjoy using it!
There *are* other factors to consider when choosing a text editor, including:
  - Code Completion, which fills code possibilities as you type and might also auto-close tags
  - Syntax Highlighting, which mad=kes the readability of the code easier by color-coding
  - Variety of Themes, which can assist with preventing eye-fatigue
  - Variety of Extensions, plug-ins that allow your ability to grow as your experience grows
  
Some computers come pre-populated with text editors.
__For example:__
 - Windows comes with Notepad software
 - Macs come with Text Edit software
 
*Be sure that if you are using these programs that they are in plain-text, create a folder for storage, and save your files with appropriate file names*

  # The Command Line
  
  Within a terminal or text editor lies the command line. The *command line* is a text-based user interface with the operating system that consists of a prompt and a command. 
  Once the command is entered, additional line of text for running the command follow. 
  Once a process has been completed, the prompt displays again underneath the completed function. 
  
  Within the terminal there is also a __shell__. Ryan Chadwick explains that the shell:
  >is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.
  
  # Terminal Cheat Sheet
  
  * Print Working Directory -> **pwd**
    - Tells user what their current working directory is
    
  * What is in Current Location -> **ls**
    - Tells user the contents of their current location.
  
  * Paths
  
     - __*Absolute Path*__
     Ryan Chadwick defines absolute paths as specifying:
     >a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
   
     - __*Relative Path*__
     Ryan Chadwick defines relative paths as specifying:
     >a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
     
     - Additional Path Shortcuts
       - ~ 
         - Shortcut to Home Directory
       - .
         - Reference to Current Directory
       - ..
         - Reference to Parent Directory
         
   * Change Directory -> **cd**
     - Allows for movement around the system
   
   * /etc
     - Stores config files for the system
   
   * /var/log
     - Stores log files for various system programs
   
   * /bin
     - The location of several commonly used programs
     
   * /usr/bin
     - Another location for system programs
