## Spring RESTful Routing & Static Files

Spring MVC's `@RequestMapping`is an annotation used to map web requests to Spring Controller methods.

You can use @RequestMapping via paths and the HTTP method. 

To narrow the mapping, a header (even *multiple* headers!) can be specified for the request.

### Spring Data Repositories

1. `JpaRepository`
    - provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence context and delete records in a batch
    - contains the full API of `CrudRepository` and `PagingAndSortingRepository`
    - methods:
      - findAll() : get a List of all available entities in database
      - findAll(…) : get a List of all available entities and sort them using the provided condition
      - save(…) : save an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to save them in a batch
      - flush() : flush all pending task to the database
      - saveAndFlush(…) : save the entity and flush changes immediately
      - deleteInBatch(…) : delete an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to delete them in a batch

1. `PagingAndSortingRepository`
    - provides methods to do pagination and sort records
    - extends `CrudRepository`
    - provides method `findAll(Pageable pageable)`
      - key to implementing Pagination
    - must specify:
      - Page Size
      - Current Page Number
      - Sorting

1. `CrudRepository`
    - provides CRUD functions
    - CRUD functionality
      - save(…) : save an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to save them in a batch
      - findOne(…) : get a single entity based on passed primary key value
      - findAll() : get an Iterable of all available entities in database
      - count() : return the count of total entities in a table
      - delete(…) : delete an entity based on the passed object
      - exists(…) : verify if an entity exists based on the passed primary key value

### Points of Caution with Spring Data Repositories

- must be careful not to expose internal implementation details

- extending repositories exposes a complete set of persistence methods at once, so to gain more fine-grained control over exposed methods, create a `ReadOnlyRepository` that doesn't contain those methods.
