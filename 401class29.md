## Room

What is Room?
- Room allows for the saving of data in a local database that is persistent

Three Components of Room  
1. Database
  - contains database holder
  - serves as the main access point for the connection to the app's data

2. Entity
  - represents a table within the database

3. Data Access Objects (DAO)
  - contains the methods used for accessing the database
  - Can be either:
    - interface
    - abstract class

Annotations
  - `@Insert`
    - generates an implementation that inserts all parameters into the database in a single transaction
  - `@Update`
    - modifies a set of entities, given as parameters, in the database
  -`@Delete`
    - removes a set of entities, given as parameters, from the database
  -`@Query`
    - the main annotation used in DAO classes
    - allows you to perform read/write operations on a database
