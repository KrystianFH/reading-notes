## 1. Mastering *Markdown* 
  - Markdown is used to style text, on pages like Github.
  - Aside from styling text, Markdown can be used to add *images, tables, and links*!
  - Markdown even supports __Emoji__!! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: :wink: :relaxed: 
 `Emojis do not populate in theme :(`

## 2. Growth Mindset

I have been ruminating on __Growth Mindset__ a lot lately. I first heard of the concept in March at the start of the COVID-19 quarantine, and I did not spend much time researching the growth mindset because of other issues that were going on at the same time. However, I enjoyed our walkthrough in class and was able to commit more focus to really digesting what it means to have a __growth__ mindset over a ~~fixed~~ mindset.

Reflecting on my mindset, I would agree with Roger in that I can find myself having a ~~fixed~~ mindset from time to time. 

In our reading, Steve Haffenden put a name to my seasonal ailment:
  >In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Persig talks about the “gumption trap” – the phenomenon of knowing what needs to be done, but lacking the motivation to do it. 

Sometimes I bank on my intelligence and talent to get me through life, rather than putting in the effort to maximize my potential in a given area. I realize that with coding, my intelligence and talent will not get me there. Since completing my enlistment in the Army, I haven't found an area that feels _right_ for a career for me, for life. This feeling stemmed from a combination of a fixed mindset and not finding jobs that felt fulfilling. I know in order to feel fulfilled I need to be working on something that has meaning and will make an impact in some shape or form. 

When I find myself in a rut of having a ~~fixed~~ mindset, it will be important to remember that:
    1. I should *embrace* challenges, not avoid them.
    2. When faced with obstacles, I should __persist__ instead of allowing myself to lose focus.
    3. Making an effort is NOT a fruitless task, but will allow for more reward.
    4. When met with criticism or feedback, I should embrace it and not ignore it.
    5. I must be _inspired_ by others' success and not feel threatened by it. 

### No one was born with the skills for success, but we have to make a conscious effort every day to persevere in order to reach our full potential!
