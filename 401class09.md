## WRRC and Java

### The HTTP Request Lifecycle

1. Local Processing
  - Browser extracts:
    - scheme/protocol
  - Optional (if specified in form):
    - port number
    - resource path
    - query strings
  - Browser searches through its own cache of:
    - recently requested URLs
    - OS' cache of recent queries
    - router's cache
    - DNS cache

1. Resolve an IP
  - if cache lookup fails:
    - browser sends a DNS request, containing:
      - preconfigured IP for the DNS server
      - return IP in the header
  - once the request arrives at the DNS server:
    - the server looks for the address associated with the hostname and sends a response once found
    - if the server cannot find the hostname, it passes the request along to another DNS server that it is configured to defer to
    - this continues to happen until the hostname is found, or, an authoritative nameserver is hit.
    - if the address is never found, an error is returned.
1. Establish a TCP Connection
  - client initiates the active open by sending a SYN control packet to the server
  - server responds with a SYN-ACK message containing an acknowledgement number for the original message (x+1)
  - the client sends an ACK message back to the server with a sequence number (x+1), ensuring data is being delivered reliably
