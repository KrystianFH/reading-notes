# Computer Architecture and Logic

## What makes a computer, a computer?

All computers must do four things:
* Take Input
* Store Information
* Process Information
* Output Results  

*Input* is what we tell the computer to do.

Inputs are stored in memory, they get processed via algorithms and stored before being converted into output. 

*Output* can take the form of:
-  text
-  videos
-  photos
-  games
-  virtual reality
-  signals that direct action of robots
-  etc

## How Computers Work: Binary & Data

Computers use __binary code__ to work.

Inside of a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry information. 

One wire can have the flow of electricity be _on_ or _off_.

A signal that is _on_ can translate to mean:
-  yes
-  true
-  1
-  on

A signal that is _off_ can translate to mean: 
-  no
-  false
-  0
-  off

This _on_ and _off_ state is called a __bit__.

Bits are the smallest piece of information that a computer can store.

If you have more wires, you have more bits and with more bits **you can represent more complex information** like:  
1.  Text
    - a number is assigned to each letter
1.  Graphics (Images, video, games)
    - each pixel has color, represented by a number
1.  Sound
    - sounds are vibrations that can be represented by waves; each point on a waveform is represented by a number

Because more bits allow for more complex information, more bits also equate to higher quality **graphics** and **sounds**.

## How Computers Work: Circuits and Logic

Computers can combine multiple inputs into a single output using **circuits**

Circuits can be:

-  "Not" Circuits
    - takes an electrical signal and flips it so that the signal that goes in is "NOT" the same as the signal going out
-  "And" Circuits
    - will only give a signal of "1" if BOTH inputs have a value of "1"
-  "Adder" Circuits
    - add the value of both inputs and gives the answer in the output
-  there are many other circuits that can perform functions like multiplication, subtraction, etc. 

The smaller the circuit, that faster the processing. This is because electricity travels at approximately the speed of light. Further distance to travel equates to faster processing and outputs.

## How Computers Work: Hardware and Software

**Hardware**
>the components inside of a computer, like:  
- circuits
- chips
- wires
- speakers
- plugs

**Software**
>all computer programs and code which tell the CPU (central processing unit) what to do

The most basic software is Binary Code. 

The Operating System is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
