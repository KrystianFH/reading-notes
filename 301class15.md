## Diversity and Inclusion

History
  - In the 1980s computers were used for game playing, and those games were marketed to boys and men, making it easier for boys to gain an advantage with computers though gaming  
  - A study in 1985 showed that 75% of men used a computer on a weekly basis, compared to 45% of women. 
  - This created a pattern of advertisers targeting boys, in order to boost sales, and boys buying the games because they were being targeted. 
      - this phenomenon is called **the experience gap**
  - A study in 1995 showed that 40% of males passed the advanced-placement computer-science exam, and were more familiar with programming languages than women, AND were more likely to report having an expert level of knowledge before enrolling in Carnegie Mellon's computer science program. 
  -This male-dominated environment has become an obstacle for women, making them feel intimidated in computer-science related courses, and very isolated. 
  -Women who do make it into a computer-science field are 45% more likely to leave the field than their male counterparts.
