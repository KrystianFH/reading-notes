## Android Fundamentals

Android apps can be written using:
- Kotlin
- Java
- C++

Android SDK Tools
- compile code with data and resource files into an APK (Android package).
  - archive file with .apk suffix
  - one apk file contains all the contents of an android app
  - the apk file is used by Android-powered devices to install the app

Android Security Features
- OS is a multi-user Linux system, each app is a different user.
- By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID and sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned can access them.
- Each app has its own virtual machine (VM) so the app's code runs in isolation from other apps.

App Components
- activities
  - entry point for interacting with the user
- services
  - general purpose entry-point for keeping an app running in the background for multiple reasons
- broadcast receivers
  - a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements
- content providers
  - manages a shared set of app data that you can store in:
    - the file system
    - a SQLite database
    - on the web
    - on any persistent storage location accessible by the app
